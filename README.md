#How to Code & Style Tables Using HTML & CSS#

This project will cover how to build tables in HTML and the different ways to style them in a stylesheet. Included will be a table that lists HTML tags, the associated tag name, as well as a brief description of their function. There will also be a table listing CSS options, their definition, and what the property options are. By building my own cheat sheet, I will be testing my current knowledge as well as practicing utilizing other resources to find solutions I don't already know.
